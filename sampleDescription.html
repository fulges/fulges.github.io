	My areas of study are Algebraic Geometry and Representation Theory, with a focus toward problems originating in Theoretical Computer Science and Quantum Information Theory. Specifically, I work on tensor decomposition problems, a problem which intuitively is about "writing complicated objects in a way that is suitable for calculations" and can be interpreted as membership in some suitable algebraic variety. This links a number of different areas, from classical invariant theory and the polynomial Waring problem, to the problem of determining the complexity of matrix multiplication, and to tensor network representation problems in quantum many-body physics.
