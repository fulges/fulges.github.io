<h2>The collineation variety in C3C3C3: smooth cases</h2>
<p>
This script verifies the claims in Thm. 4.2. The 2nd collineation variety of a tensor in C3xC3xC3 with associated smooth cubic curve is the Veronese surface.
The code computes a set of generators of the ideal of 2x2 minors, and verifies that if their span is of dimension smaller than 6, then the associated elliptic curve is singular
