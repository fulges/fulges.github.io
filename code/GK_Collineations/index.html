<h2>The collineation variety in C3xC2xCm</h2>
<p>
  This script verifies the claims in Thm. 4.1. We study the 2nd collineation variety of tensors in C3xC2xCm with m at most 6, following the classification of Landsberg's <em>Tensors: Geometry and Applications</em>, Section 10.3.

  For every orbit, we write the pencil of 3xm matrices as in the classification, we compute the associated net of 2xm matrices and we determine the associated collineation variety.

<h2>The collineation variety in C3xC3xC3: smooth cases</h2>
<p>
This script verifies the claims in Thm. 4.3. The 2nd collineation variety of a tensor in C3xC3xC3 with associated smooth cubic curve is the Veronese surface.
The code computes a set of generators of the ideal of 2x2 minors, and verifies that if their span is of dimension smaller than 6, then the associated elliptic curve is singular
