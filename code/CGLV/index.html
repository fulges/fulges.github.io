    </h3><h1> Kronecker Powers of Tensors and Strassen's Laser Method </h1>
    <h3> by A. Conner, F. Gesmundo, J. M. Landsberg, E. Ventura</h3>
We collect the supplementary files required to complete the computer
calculations described in the paper. The softwares we use are <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a> and <a href="http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/">Macaulay2</a>.

The files are collected in different appendices:


<h2>Appendix A: A randomly chosen tensor in C3 x C3 x C3 </h2>
This data file addresses the Claim of Theorem 2.8. We provide the
coordinates of a randomly chosen tensor in C3 \otimes C3 \otimes C3 and
an approximate decomposition of its Kronecker square.<br><br>

We include one file, with enclosed documentation. It contains the following two pieces of data:
<u1>
  <li> the coordinates of a tensor T in C3 \otimes C3 \otimes C3,
represented as three matrices of size 3x3, M_1,M_2,M_3: in coordinates
T_ijk = (M_i)_jk. The entries of the matrices were randomly chosen from
the uniform distribution on [-1,1];</li>
  <li> the coordinates of 22
rank one tensors in C9 \otimes C9 \otimes C9, forming a rank 22
decomposition of T \boxtimes T. This is a list of 22 elements
Z_1,...,Z_22. Each element Z_j is a list of 3 elements a,b,c. The
elements a,b,c are matrices of size 3x3 representing the coordinates of
three vectors in C9 = C3 \otimes C3. This is the same representation as
the one of Section 5 of the paper.</li>

<h2>Appendix B: Rank 18 Decomposition of 3x3 determinant </h2>
This is a Macaulay2 file which verifies the Rank 18 decomposition for the determinant polynomial, Theorem 4.1. It is one file, with enclosed
documentation.

<h2>Appendix C: Border Rank 17 Decomposition of 3x3 determinant </h2>
This is a set of files addressing Claims made in the proof of Theorem 4.2. The set consists of 7 files, which can be downloaded in
an archive tar.gz file.
<br><br>
We include seven files with enclosed documentation. The role of each file is briefly explained below:
<u1>
  <li>checkingType1eqns.m2: A Macaulay2 file verifying the equations of type 1, as explained in the paper;</li>
  <li>checkingType2eqns.m2: A Macaulay2 file verifying the equations of type 2, as explained in the paper;</li>
  <li>eqnsType1.m2: The list of equations of type 1, for easy access: they can be computed directly as well;</li>
  <li>eqnsType2.m2: The list of equations of type 2, for easy access: they can be computed directly as well;</li>
  <li>monomialsType1.m2: The monomials appearing in equations of type 1, with the corresponding expression in terms of the root y*;</li>
  <li>monomialsType2.m2:
The monomials appearing in equations of type 2, with the corresponding
expression in terms of the chosen root u in each equation;</li>
  <li>yy_exps.m2: The expressions of the elements y_j in terms of the root y*.</li>

<br><br>For the reader's convenience, we include the minimal polynomials of the
<br>
roots z_i&nbsp; with an approximation of their value in&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;det_br_17_entries.txt&nbsp; on the border rank 17 decomposition. &nbsp;

<h2>Appendix D: Matrices of Koszul flattenings of Coppersmith-Winograd powers</h2>This
set of files addresses the Claims on the matrices representing the
Koszul flattenings of the Kronecker square and the Kronecker cube of
the small Coppersmith-Winograd tensor, in the proof of Theorem 3.3 and
Theorem 3.4. The set consists of three files, which can be downloaded in an archive tar.gz file.
<br><br>
We include three files with enclosed documentation. The role of each file is briefly explained below:
<u1>
  <li>cwsquare.txt: A data file for easy access to the four
matrices Phi_1, ... , Phi_4 describing the map on the multiplicity
spaces in the proof of Theorem 2.1;</li>
  <li>cwcube.txt: A data file
for easy access to the eight matrices Psi_1, ... , Psi_8 describing the
map on the multiplicity spaces in the proof of Theorem 2.2;</li>
  <li>cwmatrices.sage:&nbsp; A sage file: it generates the relevant matrices using the method
  <br>
described in Section 6 of the paper, and computes their ranks</li>

<h2>Appendix E: Tight tensors in C3 x C3 x C3</h2>This is a Macaulay2
file addressing the Claims made in the proofs of Section 5.
Documentation is enclosed and a description of the various parts of the
file is given in the paper.

<h2>Appendix F: Decompositions of Squares of Tight tensors</h2>
This set of files contains the numerical decomposition showing the upper bounds for the Kronecker square of the tight tensors listed in Section 5.2. The archive contains 6 files, corresponding to the six tensors with numerical upper bound.

To give a decomposition with r summands, a file provides r groups of 27 lines, recording the coefficients of the three factors of the corresponding rank one element.
