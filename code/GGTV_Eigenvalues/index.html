    </h3><h1> Characteristic polynomials and eigenvalues of tensors </h1>
    <h3> by F. Galuppi, F. Gesmundo, E. Turatti, L. Venturello</h3>
We collect the supplementary material required to complete the computer calculations described in Section 6 of the paper. 
The calculations are performed in <a href="http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/">Macaulay2</a>.

<h2>Tangent Cones to the Discriminant of Plane Cubics</h2>
<p>We collect the files used in Brysiewicz-Gesmundo-Steiner for the computation of the tangent cones to the discriminant of plane cubics.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The file <a href="cubicInvs.m2">cubicInvs.m2</a> contains a hard-coded expression of the discriminant of plane cubics.
 </li>
<li>
The file <a href="tangentConesPlaneCubics_classification.m2">tangentConesPlaneCubics</a> computes the tangent cone at each normalized singular cubic.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Characteristic Polynomial of Plane Cubics</h2>
<p>We collect the files required for the computational part in the proof of Theorem 6.1.
The computation was performed on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G2 ITL, running Debian 11, on Macaulay2 v. 1.17.1.
All results were returned almost instantaneously except for the first subcase of the case where the plane curve defined by f is a line and a double line, which required a few minutes.

The file <a href="planeCubicsH.m2">planeCubicsH.m2</a> performes the calculation explained in the proof of the Theorem.
