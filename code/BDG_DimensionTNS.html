    </h3><h1> Dimension of Tensor Network Varieties </h1>
    <h3> by A. Bernardi, C. De Lazzari, F. Gesmundo</h3>
We collect the supplementary material required to complete the computer calculations described in Section 5 of the paper. 
The calculations are performed in <a href="http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/">Macaulay2</a>.

<h2>Lower bounds for the dimension of Tensor Network Varieties </h2>
The lower bound on the dimension is obtained by computing the rank of the differential 
of the parametrization map Phi (technically, of the map bar(Phi) defined on the sum of homomorphism spaces) 
defined in Section 2 at a random point of its domain.
<br><br>

The scripts compute the dimension of the image of the differential.<br>
We provide two files, one for the case of three factors (cycle C3) and one for the case of four factors (cycle C4).<br>
The user only needs to change the input nn at line 7 specifying the local dimensions they desire

<li><a href="DimensionLowerBound4Factors.m2">Script Four Factors</a></li>

Additional documentation is included in the files.

<h2>Proof of Thm. 5.2: Containment of TNS in Z</h2>
The inclusion is proved symbolically, showing that for a generic choice of local maps (X1,X2,X3), 
the tensor T = (X1,X2,X3) ( T(C3,(2,2,2)) is contained in the variety Z

The script imposes the normalization described in the proof 
then it computes the intersection L \cap sigma2
