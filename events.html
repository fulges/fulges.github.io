			<h3>[Upcoming] AGATES Workshops - Fall 2022 </h3>
			<p align="justify"> <a href="https://agates.mimuw.edu.pl/">AGATES</a> is a thematic semester on Algebraic Geometry with Applications to TEnsors and Secants. The semester runs from September 12 to December 16, 2022 and focuses on a number of aspects of the geometry of tensors. Students and young researchers are particularly invited to attend </p>
<p> I will participate as a Simons Junior Leader and I help organizing the following events within the AGATES semester:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
				<a href="https://agates.mimuw.edu.pl/index.php/agates/introductory-school">Summer School</a> on the Geometry of Tensors;
				</li>
				<li>
				<a href="https://agates.mimuw.edu.pl/index.php/agates/kickoff-workshop">Kickhoff Workshop</a> on Open Problems in the Geometry of Tensors
				</li>
				<li>
				<a href="https://agates.mimuw.edu.pl/index.php/agates/complexity">Workshop</a> on Algebraic Geometry and Complexity Theory
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>More information on these events is also available on this <a href="events/agates.html">separate page</a> and on the <a href="https://agates.mimuw.edu.pl/">main page</a> of the AGATES semester.</p>

			<h3>SIAM Minisymposium on Tensor Networks and Geometry - Summer 2021</h3>
			<p>During SIAM AG 2021, we organized a SIAM Minisymposium in two sessions (
			<a href="https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=71799">link</a> and
			<a href="https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=71800">link</a>)
			focused on geometric aspects of tensor networks. We brought together experts from geometry and from quantum physics to review some recent progress aiming to bridge the gap between the two communities in an effort to lay the path toward future collaborations.</p>

			<h3>QMATH Masterclass on Tensors: Geometry and Quantum Information - Summer 2018</h3>
			<p><a href="https://indico.nbi.ku.dk/event/1088/">This Masterclass</a> aimed to provide an overview of the latest developments and open problems in the field of tensor methods in the context of quantum many-body systems and quantum information theory. It included three minicourses by experts in these fields and additional lectures by both local and external speakers. Our  primary aim was to expose graduate students and postdocs to the latest research on some of the most important open problems in this field.</p>

                        <h3>Seminar Series</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Nonlinear Algebra Seminar at MPI MiS, Leipzig, Summer and Fall 2021</li>
			  <li>Working Seminar Series on Tensors, Copenhagen, 2018-2019</li>
			</ul>
