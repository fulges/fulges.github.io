<h2>Postdoc in Algebraic Geometry and Complexity Theory</h2>

  <p align="justify">We are announcing one <b>two year</b> position as <b>postdoctoral researcher</b> at the Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse (IMT) in the area of Algebraic Geometry with a focus toward applications in Complexity Theory. </p>

  <p align="justify"> The postdoc position is a research position with no teaching duties. The position is financially supported by Fulvio Gesmundo's CPJ funding and the successful candidate is expected to collaborate with him and the other members of IMT on Mathematical Aspects of Complexity Theory: relevant topics include, but are not limited to, tensor decomposition, algebraic complexity theory, quantum many-body physics. <br> <br>
IMT's vibrant research environment presents exceptional opportunities for academic and professional growth, including access to numerous weekly seminars and the chance to interact with leading expert mathematicians. Moreover, the broader academic community at  Université Paul Sabatier, including the neighboring institutes IRIT and LAAS, provides avenues for expanding one's intellectual pursuits and fostering valuable connections.
</p>

  <p align="justify"> The gross salary for the position ranges between 30.000 to 45.000 euros per year, depending on previous postdoctoral experience.</p>

<p><b>Employment Starting Date:</b> <br> Upon agreement, approximately October 2024. <br> </p> 

<p><b>Application Closing Date:</b> <br> March 8, 2024 </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Requirements:</b> <br>Doctoral degree (or equivalent) in Mathematics or in a related area should be completed before the starting date.</p> 


<p align="justify"><b>Research profile:</b><br>
The successful candidate is expected to have a solid background in algebraic geometry or representation theory. Some research experience in the topics relevant to the call is desirable. Written and spoken English proficiency is required. Ability to work on topics outside of one's <em>comfort zone</em> is considered valuable. 
<br>
<br>
Examples of research topics that the postdoctoral researcher will be invited to explore include:
<ul>
<li>Debordering and geometric methods in complexity theory</li>
<li>Tensor rank, related notions, and their asymptotic behaviour</li>
<li>Geometry of tensor networks</li>
</ul>
A recent survey on open problems in the areas of interest can be found <a href="https://agates.mimuw.edu.pl/images/notes_and_reports/Gesmundo_Geometry_of_Tensors_Open_Problems_and_Research_Directions.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Application:</b><br>
Applications should be sent to <a href="https://fulges.github.io/">Fulvio Gesmundo</a> via email at the address 
<br><br>
fgesmund@math.univ-toulouse.fr 
<br><br>
Please, insert the subject line "Postdoc Call 2024 - YourName" and use the body of the email as a cover letter. Include, in a single pdf file, the following material:</p>
<ul>
<li>CV, including a list of publications</li>
<li>A one page summary of scientific achievements</li>
<li>A research project of at most two pages</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Moreover, arrange for two reference letters to be sent to Fulvio Gesmundo via email with subject line "Postdoc Call 2024 - Reference letter for YourName" before the closing date of the call.
</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Selection process:</b><br>
A shortlist of candidates will be invited to an online interview. All interviews will be completed by March 31 and the successful candidate will be notified in the subsequent weeks.
